need to make a line file

while(not EOF )
    read_print_line()

So far while doing this I am encountering a segmentation fault, which could
arise from opening the files incorrectly.

read_print_line should not need to return anything, so it can just be a void
function. It will also need to take in two parameters, input and output, of type
FILE*
